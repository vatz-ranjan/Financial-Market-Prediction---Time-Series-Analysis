# FinancialMarketPrediction-TimeSeriesAnalysis-MinorProject

This research project is focused on making a regression-based Price Prediction of stocks using various statistical and machine-learning models. The target variable for the prediction was the stock's closing price, and the study focused on the Indian financial markets. The data was gathered over 25 years using the YFinance API from Yahoo Finance.
The implementation of the project involved testing the accuracy of various statistical models such as Linear Regression, AR(Auto-regressive), MA(Moving Average), ARMA (Auto-regressive moving average), ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated moving average), and LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory). The models were tested using python and the accuracy of the models was evaluated using the R Square (coefficient of determination) and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated for checking the residual error. The stock selected for the implementation was ‘BHARATFORGE’.
The purpose of the research was to analyze the data set using data mining techniques and to predict future trends using machine learning algorithms. The first step involved extracting and pre-processing the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. Next, feature selection was performed to identify the most relevant features for the analysis. A descriptive analysis was conducted to understand the characteristics of the data and formulate hypotheses for testing.
Overall, this research project demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting stock prices and the importance of pre-processing and feature selection in obtaining accurate results.
